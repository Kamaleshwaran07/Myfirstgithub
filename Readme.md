This repository is a demo for how to use Git and Github.


## Steps for creating the repository
    * Created an empty repository named **Demo** in [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
    * Copied the contents from the page titled `Create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
    ```
    echo "# demo" >> Readme.md
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "First commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Kamaleshwaran07/animated-doodle.git
    git push -u origin main

    * This first line `echo "# demo" >> Readme.md` created an Readme.md file with the content echo "# demo
    
    
    ```
